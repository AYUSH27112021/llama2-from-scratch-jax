Train a JAX code assistant 

Project Description:
In this project, you will use JAX to train an LLM to be good at 1) code generation with JAX, and 2) answering questions about JAX. This will enhance the developer experience of using JAX. The project would include both the LLM training and creating recipes for further training/updating. All the work will be open source, and we hope to have the full end-to-end process be reproducible.

Project Tasks:
Gather, curate, and preprocess datasets for Jax code generation and Jax question answering. 
Train LLM(s) for JAX code generation and question answering, using either openly available models (Gemma) or by fine-tuning Gemini via the API.
Create clear notebooks explaining the process and publish it on GitHub.
Optionally, write a blog post on your experience and the results.
